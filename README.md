# C-Workshop

Code for a C workshop I've been teaching for the last few years.

## Exam03

This project is the "official" solution to one of the exams I've been giving. It follows coding guidelines
discussed in the course, touches on subjects we've learned, and contains special notes to points of interest.

## CApp

A playground project for demonstrating various subjects as we learn them. Might contain complete and utter
garbage (that was used in class to demonstrate the evils of `#define`, for example). Use at your own peril.

* Note: All commits in this repo are done to the master branch, unless I want to demonstrate something about
Git and/or source control in general. Do not do this in real life. Thank you.
